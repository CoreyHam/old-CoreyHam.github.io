# Week 1
> ### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

## **Yes and No,**

What I was Expecting | What I was not Expecting
------------ | -------------
Joining a team of future web developers | Having to get used to GitHub and GitPods
Having to work on new assignments/projects | 

> ### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

## I have some knowledge on html and css, but I would definitly like to learn more about JavaScript. Being able to invision how a website should look and act and then being able to make it happen is an exciting skill to learn.

> ### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

## I am really into video games. I started my interest in video games when I was a child. My Uncle had an N64, which soon became my favorite console. One of my best memories is me and my cousin trying our hardest to beat [Majora's Mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask) together and getting scared of **the moon**.
