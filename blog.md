# Week 1
> ### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

## **Yes and No,**

What I was Expecting | What I was not Expecting
------------ | -------------
Joining a team of future web developers | Having to get used to GitHub and GitPods
Having to work on new assignments/projects | 

> ### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

## I have some knowledge on html and css, but I would definitely like to learn more about JavaScript. Being able to envision how a website should look and act and then being able to make it happen is an exciting skill to learn.

> ### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

## I am really into video games. I started my interest in video games when I was a child. My Uncle had an N64, which soon became my favorite console. One of my best memories is me and my cousin trying our hardest to beat [Majora's Mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask) together while getting scared of **the moon**.

# Week 2
> ### What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

##  I wish I could code my own video game completely from scratch with my own assets. I think that would be a fun way to test my skills as a programmer.

> ### What are you struggling with?

## I am struggling with making my own code without looking for help. I think with time different commands and concepts will become easier to remember and come up with. 

> ### How do you solve a problem?

## I take a step back and look at the full picture, identify the problem, and think through different ways of handling that problem. Once I think of some possible solutions I play around with the ideas and test them. Specifically with coding, I like to write it out first. Seeing my ideas on paper helps me think it through. Then I type out my solutions and test them out. If a solution doesn't work I look for problems within my 'solution' and break it down further.

> ### What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?

## If I have struggled with the program and I cant figure it out myself, I usually reach out for help from someone else. Sometimes a different perspective can help a lot, and sometimes the thing that is breaking the code is really small and all you need is for someone to point out the missing semicolon.

# Week 3
> ### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?

##  I think that it all makes sense in how they work together. This week we had to make an alarm clock that displayed the current time and it really showed me how the three work together seamlessly. I had to make a button that I created on HTML cause a function to happen on my JavaScript that would then change the style of an element in my CSS. I feel better about working with these three.
